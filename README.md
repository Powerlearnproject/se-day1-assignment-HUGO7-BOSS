#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the application of engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
IMPORTANCE
Economic growth due to job creation(software developers, project managers etc) and revenue generation
Digital transformation due to innovation of products and services that shape the way we live and work
Software engineers develop solutions to complex problems in various fields e.g healthcare, finance, education ete

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1960s: The term "software engineering" was first used in a NATO conference, highlighting the need for a more systematic approach to software development.
2. 1969: The first software engineering conference was held, focusing on defining the field and its principles.
3. 1970s and 1980s: The development of structured programming, object-oriented programming, and software engineering methodologies like Waterfall and Agile contributed significantly to the evolution of the field.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning & Analysis: This initial phase involves gathering business requirements from stakeholders, evaluating feasibility, and planning the project. It sets the foundation for what needs to be developed.
2. Requirements Definition: In this phase, the information gathered during planning is converted into detailed requirements. This ensures that the development team understands what needs to be built.
3. Design: This phase involves creating the architecture of the software. It includes both high-level design (overall system architecture) and detailed design (detailed specifications for each component).
4. Development: Here, the actual coding takes place. Developers write the code based on the design documents and specifications.
5. Testing: The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix any bugs or issues. This ensures the software meets the required quality standards.
6. Deployment: Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to a production environment where it can be used by end-users.
9. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is updated and improved based on user feedback and changing requirement.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison; Waterfall and Agile are two primary methodologies used in software development. They differ significantly in their approaches to project management and development.
Key differences;
1. Flexibility: Agile is more flexible in adapting to changes, while Waterfall is more rigid.
2. Planning: Waterfall requires extensive upfront planning, while Agile emphasizes incremental planning.
3. Customer involvement: Agile involves customers closely throughout the development process, while Waterfall has limited customer involvement.
4. Risk management: Agile is better suited for managing risks associated with changing requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting appropriate instructions that helps AI generate desired outputs
IMPORTANCE 
Helps AI refine output overtime and present it in the required format.
Improves user experience since AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.
Gives developers' greater control over users' interactions with AI.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague- "where to get a dress"
Concise- "where to get a dress(black) for a dinner party in a high-end restaurant"
The improved prompt is more effective since context(dinner meaning at night ) and preferences for the dress to be black have been given.
